## Setup

Run `setup.sh` under this directory, it will do the following things sequentially:

- Create a directory `nycu-iais-dl2024-taiwanese-asr/` at parent directory.
- Clone espnet into `nycu-iais-dl2024-taiwanese-asr/`.
- Set up a conda environment and install espnet.
- Download and unzip the dataset.
- Remove the unneeded receipes under `espnet/egs2`, and use `TEMPLATE` to generate `my-receipe`.
- Move the dataset into `my-reseipe/asr1/downloads`.
- Copy data preparation scripts, config yamls and run scripts for each task into `my-receipe`.
- Install additional dependencies, such as s3prl, whisper, loralib.

## Data preparation

Two files are copied into `myreceipe/asr1/local`.

### `data_prep.py`

This script has two purposes:

1. Split the original train dataset into train set and valid set randomly.
2. Create `text`, `wav.scp` and `utt2spk` files for train, val and test in Kalid format into `my-receipe/asr1/data`.

### `data.sh`

This script is used in `asr.sh` to:

1. Invoke `data_prep.py`.
2. Sort line order for generated files.
3. Create `spk2utt` files for each set.

## Task 1

### Configuration

In task 1, we choose a **Branchformer** as the encoder, and a **Transformer** as the decoder. A branchformer encoder can efficiently handles long audio sequences, which enables better feature extraction from audio signals. On the other hand, a transformer decoder leverages language modeling capability for accurate transcription, and offers flexibility in modeling language and context.

The training config is modified from `egs2/aishell/asr1/conf/tuning/train_asr_branchformer_e24_amp.yaml`. It is almost identical to the original one, except `batch_bins` are modified as **3000000**, to accomodate the memory limitation from graphic card.

**Adam** is adopted for the optimizer, with **warmuplr** as the learning rate scheduler. The initial learning rate is set by **1.0e-3**.

In the run script, a data augmentation of **speed perturbation** is specified, and the token type is set as **char**. A character tokenizer operates at the character level and treats each character in the text as a seperate token, which is more suitable for Taiwanese language.

Finally, a maximum number of epochs is set by **60**, to prevent the training being too time-consuming.

### Training

The train and valid accuracy over the training process are shown below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task1/acc.png?raw=true" alt="acc-task1"/>
</p>

We can see that even though being diverged for a while, the valid accuracy stays quite close with the train accuracy, and both values grow over the training process.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task1/loss.png?raw=true" alt="loss-task1"/>
</p>

The loss decreases with some fluctuations, and its trend is in correspondence with the accuracy as well.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task1/wer.png?raw=true" alt="wer-task1"/>
</p>

The trend in wer is similar. All three plots suggest that our training in task 1 is successful.

### Result

The final wer scoring over the testing data:

- Public: 0.658
- Private: 0.62739

## Task 2

### Configuration

In task 2, we are asked to combine a SSL (Self-Supervised Learning) pre-trained model to ASR, using S3PRL toolkit.

The training config is modified from `egs2/librispeech/asr1/conf/tuning/train_asr_conformer7_wav2vec2_960hr_large.yaml`. The upstream model adopted here is **WavLM**, which is a type of language model designed to operate directly on raw audio waveforms rather than on text representations. Here we use `wavlm_base` and `batch_bins` is set by **2000000**.

Besides the pre-trained frontend, the encoder adopted in this task is **Conformer**, which leverages the strengths of both convolutional neural networks and transformers to achieve efficient feature extraction.

The optimizer and the learning rate scheduler are still **adam** and **warmuplr**. The initial learning rate are set to **2.5e-3**.

The run script has the same config as task 1. The maximum number of epochs is set by **35**.

### Training

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task2/acc.png?raw=true" alt="acc-task2"/>
</p>

The accuracy grows faster than task 1 over epochs. The increment is not significant after the 24th epoch, so maybe we can set a lower number of maximum epoch to save time.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task2/loss.png?raw=true" alt="loss-task2"/>
</p>

The improvement can also be noticed in the loss.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task2/wer.png?raw=true" alt="wer-task2"/>
</p>

The convergence of wer in task 2 is more faster and stable.

### Result

The final wer scoring over the testing data:

- Public: 0.57022
- Private: 0.56481

Both scoring are better than task 1. It shows that combining a pre-trained model can improve the performance of a ASR task.

## Task 3

### Configuration

In task 3, we are asked to complete the ASR task with OpenAI Whisper, which is a general-purpose speech recognition model. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.

The training config is modified from `egs2/aishell/asr1/conf/tuning/train_asr_whisper_medium_lora_finetune.yaml`. The model size we adopted here for the encoder and the decoder are both the **small** model. The `batch_bins` are set by **3000000**.

Moreover, to fintune the whisper model, the adapter `LoRA` is specified. An adapter is layer added to a pre-trained model to adapt it to specific tasks or domains without extensively retraining the entire model. Adapters are designed to introduce task-specific knowledge into a pre-trained model by learning only a small number of parameters, thus preserving the general knowledge learned during pre-training.

The optimizer is set as **adamw**, and the learning rate scheduler is still **warmuplr**. The initial learning rate is set as **1.25e-05**, which is recommended in [this README](https://github.com/vasistalodagala/whisper-finetune).

For the run script, we also specified the tokenizer as **whisper_multilingual**.

In this task, the training of each epoch is more time-consuming, and the valid accuracy did not improve much over epochs, therefore we opt for a maximum of **10** epochs.

### Training

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task3/acc.png?raw=true" alt="acc-task3"/>
</p>

The train accuarcy is already at 0.65 when the first epoch finishs, and the valid accuracy is even at 0.95, which both out-performed the previous two tasks. After 10 epochs, the train accuracy steadily grew to 0.95, while valid accuracy only improved by 0.025.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task3/loss.png?raw=true" alt="loss-task3"/>
</p>

We may notice that there is a slight growth in the valid loss, meaning it might exists an overfitting situation. However, since both the train and valid loss are way smaller than the ones from the previous tasks, this situation is acceptable.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/hank-chouu/Taiwanese-ASR-with-ESPNET/blob/main/img/task3/wer.png?raw=true" alt="wer-task3"/>
</p>

The wer scoring after the first epoch finishs is very small, comparing to the previous two tasks. After 10 epochs, the differeces became not that significant, but still better.

### Result

The final wer scoring over the testing data:

- Public: 0.26092
- Private: 0.26828

The scoring are the best among three tasks. It shows that Whisper has a better performance than a pre-trained model over an ASR task.

## Comparison & Conclusion

The key finding in this assignment is that by "standing upon the shoulders of giants", the fine-tuned models are more powerful and robust than the model we trained from scratch using transformer-based architecture. By far, OpenAI Whisper is the most powerful pre-trained model for ASR tasks.

On the other hands, after watching the reports from classmates with highest scores, I realized there are several improvement for me can be made:

- **Add noises to the train data:** I forgot that the testing data on Kaggle are modified with noises. To equip the model with the ability to detect noise, we should also introduce the noise into the triaing process, by modify the training data with noises. Moreover, the amount of noise can be adjusted as well.
- **Try different split ratio:** Adjusting the ratio between train/valid and use a bigger valid set may help prevent the model being overfitted.
